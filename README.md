# Monster Chase

## Project Description

### Motivation
The point of this project is to help me learn the Python language by coding a simple game using the skills I learned through freeCodeCamp.org's Space Invaders Pygame Tutorial.

### The Idea
> * To build a simple single-player game consisting of one player and one enemy.
> * The player has three lives and must avoid the enemy by jumping over them.
> * Press the left and right arrow keys to move and the space bar to jump.
> * The game will end when all three lives are used up.

### How This Will Be Accomplished
> * Languages / Tools / Libraries / Technologies:
>    * [Python Language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/) - The most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.
>    * [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - An integrated development environment used in computer programming, specifically for the Python language.
>    * [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) - A cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games.
